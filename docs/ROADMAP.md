# Roadmap

What is worth doing next, in the order it would be heard. Items are
recorded here when they come up so they are not lost; nothing here is
promised. See `ANALYSIS.md` for how changes are judged (measure first, ear
second) and `CHANGELOG.md` for what has shipped.

## Sound quality

These change how every note sounds, not what notes are played.

- **Release envelopes — done (branch `releases`, 2026-10-14).** Sustained
  voices now carry a sustain loop and a decaying tail; the generator writes
  note-off for them so each family releases at its own pace
  (`samples.RELEASE`, `samples.PRESET_RELEASE`). Lengths are a first draft
  set by principle and await tuning by ear. One-shot voices (plucks, drums)
  still end on their own.
- **Reverb/echo on more than the lead.** The SNES echo ran on most voices.
  Harmony and arp echo returns at lower level, on the existing two echo
  channels or two more.
- **Mix by palette, fully.** Only the arp is palette-specific today. Per-
  palette tables for every channel, set by ear, the way the arp levels were.

## Arrangement

- **Chip chord stabs (J effect).** The `Jxy` arpeggio command cycles one
  channel through three notes fast enough to read as a chord — the
  definitive NES trick. Add it as an *occasional* arp figure in the chip
  palette (off-beat stabs where each hit carries the whole triad via J),
  not a default: on a track that already has a pulse lead, pulse harmony
  and a pluck arp it can turn to mush. Keep if it earns its place by ear.
- **Arp register motion.** Climbing figures alternate bars an octave up
  today. Let a figure sit low in the verse and high in the chorus, or fall
  into a chord change, with the existing melody-collision check so the arp
  stays out of the lead's register.
- **Drum ghost notes and velocity shape.** Drums have humanised hats and
  nothing else: no ghost snares, no accent pattern across the bar.
- **Per-section instrumentation.** Beyond the layer map, a plan for which
  voice carries which role per section (e.g. the pad drops out of the verse,
  the lead swaps for the bridge — the alt-lead swap is the only case today).
- **Harmony colour on pads.** The SNES arp now takes 7ths and 9ths; the
  pad voicings could carry an add9 or a 7th in the same palette.

## Generation

From `ANALYSIS.md` §5, unchanged:

- **Corpus statistics, no neural net.** n-gram tables for chord transitions,
  melodic intervals conditioned on scale degree and chord tone, and real
  rhythm-template frequencies, trained offline from symbolic chiptune and
  shipped as JSON. Keeps the zero-dependency property.
- **A small conditioned model for the melody line only**, with structure
  and arrangement staying in deterministic code.
- **A local LLM as arranger**, producing a typed style brief (key, scale,
  progression set, form, palette, energy curve) that drives the engine.

## Game integration

bitComposer is intended, eventually, as the music engine of a game the
author is building. Nothing here is near-term; it is recorded so the
composer's design keeps the door open.

- **The shape of it.** The game would not run Python. It needs a composer
  that produces module bytes and libopenmpt to play them; libopenmpt has
  C, C++, Rust and C# bindings and runs inside Unity and Godot today. The
  port of the composer is the only real work, and seeded determinism makes
  it verifiable byte for byte against this Python reference, which stays
  the design workbench.
- **Loop form.** Level music loops without an ending: a form whose last
  pattern leads back into its first.
- **Intensity layers.** The same seed rendered at two or three energy
  tiers with identical form, so a game can crossfade between them on the
  beat as the state changes. Seeded section reuse makes this natural.
- **Transitions and stingers.** Short fills or hits in the piece's key and
  palette to bridge one state to another.
- **Palette as a game parameter**, per area or faction.
- **In-browser generation** for the listening page is the same problem in
  miniature; Pyodide (CPython in WebAssembly, ~7 MB) would run the
  dependency-free generator unchanged and is the first thing to try.

## Player

- HiDPI control sizes (fonts and popup already scale; buttons and sliders
  are still fixed pixels).
- Social preview image for the repository.
